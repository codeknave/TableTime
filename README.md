# TableTime

Add your own rollable tables with simple text files.

Add text files to a folder and the GUI will autopopulate. Advanced tables, AKA generators are also possible. See example generators in the advanced tables folder.
Basic tables are just lines of items that are rolled randomly. 1 line per item.

Roadmap:
Rename labels and variables
Add a button that makes a new text file, opens it for editing
Weighted rolls
Custom max columns, rows, page numbers
